For this project, imagine you are an engineer at a social media startup. You are tasked with building out a platform where users can create, share, and discover short-form video content, just like TikTok.

Project Requirements:

Allow users to like and comment on videos, and let them share and favorite videos
Implement a smart recommendation system for what videos a user sees on their feed
Challenges:

Implement a moderation system to prevent users from uploading inappropriate content
Make your recommendation system adaptive based on the user's most recent activity
Ensure minimal latency in the video uploads and playback
